Unofficial Bible Gateway Verse Of The Day for Spigot

This is a very simple plugin for Spigot (Minecraft) which loads the Verse Of The Day from BibleGateway.com and can display it to users. On it's own, it doesn't do a lot. The intention is to use other plugins to control how players see the verse.
For example, on my own server, I use Holographic Scoreboard by R4zorax to create a floating verse in the server spawn area.

I am not a programmer. The code is terrible. But it compiles for me and works.

The "unofficial" in the title refers to the fact Bible Gateway have nothing to do with this plugin. Do not contact them for any support, bugs, etc. They won't even have a clue what you're talking about.
